# 🏷 Tag Generator

An interactive Tag Generator built with Vanilla JavaScript.

This project focuses on DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic state management.  
The HTML and CSS structure were pre-built, and the JavaScript functionality was implemented from scratch.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. The user types a tag and presses Enter
2. The input value is trimmed and validated
3. If valid and not duplicated, the tag is added to the list
4. The remaining tag counter updates automatically
5. Each tag includes a remove button for individual deletion
